These timing functions are used to create animation effects by describing the acceleration and deceleration of animations through different mathematical formulas. Here's a natural language description of these timing functions:

1. **easeInSine, easeOutSine, easeInOutSine**: 
   - These functions use a sine function to smoothly start and end animations. `easeInSine` starts slowly and then accelerates; `easeOutSine` decelerates towards the end; `easeInOutSine` accelerates in the middle, with slow start and end.

2. **easeInQuad, easeOutQuad, easeInOutQuad**:
   - These functions use a quadratic equation to describe animations. `easeInQuad` starts slowly and then accelerates; `easeOutQuad` decelerates towards the end; `easeInOutQuad` accelerates in the middle, with slow start and end.

3. **easeInCubic, easeOutCubic, easeInOutCubic**:
   - These functions use a cubic equation to describe animations. `easeInCubic` starts slowly and then accelerates; `easeOutCubic` decelerates towards the end; `easeInOutCubic` accelerates in the middle, with slow start and end.

4. **easeInQuart, easeOutQuart, easeInOutQuart**:
   - These functions use a quartic equation to describe animations. `easeInQuart` starts slowly and then accelerates; `easeOutQuart` decelerates towards the end; `easeInOutQuart` accelerates in the middle, with slow start and end.

5. **easeInQuint, easeOutQuint, easeInOutQuint**:
   - These functions use a quintic equation to describe animations. `easeInQuint` starts slowly and then accelerates; `easeOutQuint` decelerates towards the end; `easeInOutQuint` accelerates in the middle, with slow start and end.

6. **easeInExpo, easeOutExpo, easeInOutExpo**:
   - These functions use an exponential function to describe animations. `easeInExpo` starts very slowly and then accelerates rapidly; `easeOutExpo` decelerates rapidly towards the end; `easeInOutExpo` accelerates in the middle, with slow start and end.

7. **easeInCirc, easeOutCirc, easeInOutCirc**:
   - These functions use a circular function to describe animations. `easeInCirc` starts slowly and then accelerates; `easeOutCirc` decelerates towards the end; `easeInOutCirc` accelerates in the middle, with slow start and end.

8. **easeInBack, easeOutBack, easeInOutBack**:
   - These functions slightly overshoot the boundary at the start or end, then return to the target position. `easeInBack` starts slowly and then accelerates; `easeOutBack` decelerates towards the end; `easeInOutBack` accelerates in the middle, with slow start and end.

9. **easeInElastic, easeOutElastic, easeInOutElastic**:
   - These functions simulate elastic motion, with a bouncing effect at the start or end. `easeInElastic` starts slowly and then accelerates; `easeOutElastic` decelerates towards the end; `easeInOutElastic` accelerates in the middle, with slow start and end.

10. **easeBounce**:
    - This function simulates a bouncing effect, with several rebounds towards the end of the animation.

These timing functions help create more natural and smooth animation effects.

In common usage, we input it as a parameter in `.animate()` method:

```vue
<script setup>
import { usePlayer, useWidget } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@vue-motion/core@latest/dist/index.js'
import { Motion, Rect, move, easeInOutSine } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@vue-motion/lib@0.6.0/dist/index.js'
import { onMounted } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@3.5.12/dist/vue.esm-browser.js'

const { play, useAnimation } = usePlayer()
const rect = useWidget('rect')

onMounted(() => {
  useAnimation(rect)
    .animate(move, {
      duration: 1, // Use 1 second.
      offsetX: 200,
      offsetY: 300,
      by: easeInOutSine,
    })
  play()
})
</script>

<template>
  <Motion :width="1600" :height="900">
    <Rect :width="200" :height="200" wid="rect"/>
  </Motion>
</template>
```

You need to import it first.
